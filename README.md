## What is it for?
It's a visualization tool for relational databases, implemented using web technologies.
Visualizations were implemented with D3.js.

1. Copy the whole content of the source directory to your desired directory on the webserver.
2. Go to the index page of you directory.
3. To setup your first database to visualize, go to the setup page (use the link on the welcome page or go directly to directory/setup.php).
